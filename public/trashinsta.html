<!-- Detailed Guide Section -->
<section class="guide-section">
  <h2>Complete Guide: How to Download Your Instagram Data</h2>
  <p>Instagram provides users with the ability to download their personal data as part of privacy regulations like GDPR. This data includes your followers, following lists, posts, messages, and more. Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide to help you get your data safely and securely:</p>
  
  <div class="guide-steps">
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 1: Access Instagram Settings</h3>
      <p>Open Instagram on your mobile device or visit instagram.com on your computer. Navigate to your profile by tapping your profile picture in the bottom right corner. Then tap the three lines (hamburger menu) in the top right corner and select "Settings".</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 2: Navigate to Privacy and Security</h3>
      <p>In the Settings menu, scroll down and look for "Privacy and Security" or "Account". The exact location may vary depending on your app version. This section contains all privacy-related options including data download.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 3: Find Download Your Information</h3>
      <p>Look for "Download Your Information" or "Data Download" option. This feature allows you to request a copy of all your Instagram data, including photos, videos, messages, and importantly, your followers and following lists.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 4: Select Data Types</h3>
      <p>Choose "Some of your information" rather than "All available information" to get a smaller, faster download. Specifically select "Followers and Following" as this is what our tool needs to analyze your non-followers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 5: Choose Format and Request</h3>
      <p>Select HTML format (recommended) as it's easier to process than JSON. Choose your preferred date range - usually "All time" gives you the complete picture. Submit your request and wait for Instagram to prepare your data.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="step-detailed">
      <h3>Step 6: Download and Upload</h3>
      <p>Instagram will email you when your data is ready (usually within 48 hours). Download the ZIP file and upload it directly to our tool for instant analysis!</p>

<!-- Blog Section -->
<section class="blog-section">
  <h2>Instagram Tips and Social Media Insights</h2>
  
  <article class="blog-post">
    <h3>The Psychology Behind Instagram Following Behavior</h3>
    <p>Understanding why people follow and unfollow accounts can help you build better relationships on social media. Research shows that users typically follow accounts for content value, personal connection, or aspirational reasons. When content no longer serves these purposes, unfollows naturally occur. By analyzing your non-followers, you can identify patterns in your content performance and audience preferences.</p>
  </article>
  
  <article class="blog-post">
    <h3>Building Authentic Engagement in 2024</h3>
    <p>The social media landscape continues evolving, with authenticity becoming more important than ever. Users are increasingly selective about who they follow and engage with. Focus on creating genuine connections rather than just accumulating followers. Quality engagement from a smaller, dedicated audience often provides better results than passive followers who never interact with your content.</p>
  </article>
  
  <article class="blog-post">
    <h3>Instagram Algorithm Changes and Their Impact</h3>
    <p>Instagram's algorithm continues prioritizing meaningful interactions and relevant content. Understanding your follower relationships helps you create content that resonates with engaged users, improving your content's visibility and reach. Use insights from non-follower analysis to refine your content strategy and build stronger connections with your most active audience members.</p>
